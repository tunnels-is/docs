The client application enabled some debug logging by default, this is to help users figure out whats wrong and to help us help users.<br/>
However, ALL logging can be turned off in the UI for both the UI (browser console) and the application itself.<br/>
**Out stance on logging is that is the user should always be able to turn it off completely, we even keep our website free of analytics and cookies.**<br/>
The VPN server also has a `--silent` flag to disable all logging.

## How To Disanle Logging

When all logging options are turned off, the app will not log to file or to console.<br/>
This applies to the UI as well.

```md
1. Go to `Application`
2. Go to `General Settings`
3. Unckeck all the logging options
```

## Enable Debug Logging
